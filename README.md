Wordmorph - Algorithms and data structures aplied to programming
Sep 2016 â€“ Jan 2017

Project descriptionFor this project we were given a word to morph and a destination word in a text file and we were asked to transform one word into another using the least amount of character permutations possible with the following rules:
The word that resulted from the permutation of the previous word has to be in a given dictionary 
If you permutated more that 1 letter is counts squared (i.e if i permute 2 letters the associated cost is 4)
In this project we used shortest path algorithms, several complex data structures such as graphs and machine learning, in order to optimize our algorithm.
